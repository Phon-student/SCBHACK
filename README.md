# PROJECT STIR FRIED 

Project Stir Fried is GAN inspire AI and dataset generator for low reasource languages. By implementing TEXTGAIL and Self-explain architecture. to both dataset generator and AI model layer.


## TextGAIL: Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning for Text Generation

Inspire by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).this is text generation that uses large pre-trained language models to provide more reliable reward guidance. Our approach uses contrastive discriminator, and proximal policy optimization (PPO) to stabilize and improve text generation performance to create dataset.

## Self-Explaining Structures

framework is to put an additional layer,
as is called by the interpretation layer, on top
of any existing NLP model. This layer aggregates the information for each text span, which
is then associated with a specific weight, and
their weighted combination is fed to the softmax function for the final prediction.
